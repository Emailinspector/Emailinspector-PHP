# Api - Bulk emails verification

When to use:

This tool created for customers that want to upload emails list and download results in automatic mode. For example if you using bulk verification tool you need to: login to our service, open upload form, choose file, wait until file will be finished, download results. But this API allow to do this work for your software in fully automatic mode without login to site.


How it works:
1. your software uploading file with emails to our API and getting {file_id} as result

2. your software checking status of file by {file_id} (once per 10 minutes for example)

3. when status of file is "finished", your software downloading reports


# Upload file with API:

There is link for file upload:
https://app.emailinspector.io/api/verifyApiFile?secret=PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&filename=NAME_OF_YOUR_FILE
 
 Example of PHP code:
 
  $key = "PUT YOUR API KEY HERE";
$settings['file_contents'] ="@/home/Downloads/emails.txt"; //path to your file
$url = 'https://app.emailinspector.io/api/verifApiFile?secret='.$key.'&filename=emails.txt';
$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $settings);
$file_id = curl_exec($ch); //you need to save this FILE ID for get file status and download reports in future
curl_close($ch);

Example of output when success: 10700 Example of output when error happens :

. Status=" no_credit"- Your balance is $0.

. Status=" cannot_upload_file"- File uploaded as broken.

. Status=" key_not_valid"- No api key provided in request or invalid.

. Status=" missing parameters"- There are no validations remaining to complete this attempt.


# Get file info with API:

There is link that you need to request:
https://app.emailinspector.io/api/getApiFileInfo?secret=PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&id=FILE_ID_OF_ALREADY_UPLOADED_FILE

$key = "PUT YOUR API KEY HERE";

$url = 'https://app.emailinspector.io/api/getApiFileInfo?secret='.$key.'&id=10700';

$string = file_get_contents($url);

list($file_id,$filename,$unique,$lines,$lines_processed,$status,$timestamp,$link1,$link2) = explode('|',$string); //parse data


Example of output for file that in progress : 10700|my_emails.txt|no|200|150|progress|1445878121||

Example of output for file that already finished :
10700|my_emails.txt|no|200|200|finished|1445878121|https://app.emailinspector.io/app/webroot/files/52/655/result_ok_10700_2015-10-26.csv|https://app.emailinspector.io/app/webroot/files/52/655/result_all_10700_2015-10-26.csv
